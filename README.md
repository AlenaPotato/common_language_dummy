# common_language_dummy

This table provides a list of country pairs on a common language dummy together with ISO 3166 country codes (alpha-2 and alpha-3). The creation of this table was inspired by my university project which was dedicated to study student mobility between different countries.

The data was taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_official_languages and represents a list of country pairs on a common language dummy.
