# Common language dummy

This table provides a list of country pairs on a common language dummy together with ISO 3166 country codes (alpha-2 and alpha-3). The creation of this table was inspired by my university project which was dedicated to study student mobility between different countries.

The data was taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_official_languages and represents a list of country pairs on a common language dummy.

Language	Name of a common language.
Language dummy	1 for common language dummy.
Country of origin	Name of country of origin.
Country of destination	Name of country of destination.
Alpha-2 code (origin)	Two-character origin country code.
Alpha-3 code (origin)	Three-character origin country code.
Alpha-2 code (destination)	Two-character destination country code.
Alpha-3 code (destination)	Three-character destination country code.
